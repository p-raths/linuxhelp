## which version should i chose.

For a first time linux its always good to chose something like ubuntu. It's easy to use and a lot of it's software is pre installed so you don't need to add anything for nomal use
When you start with Ubuntu you can easaly switch to Debian or another Debian based system. 

Hear is a little list for you

At the moment i use Debian and Lubuntu on my two Laptops. If you have a laptop with touch screen do not install Debian :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
It hase very limited touch support and you need to set up everything by your own.
